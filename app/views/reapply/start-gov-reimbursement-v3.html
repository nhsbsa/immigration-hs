        Apply for an immigration health surcharge reimbursement if you work in health and social care
    </h1>
  
<p>You may be able to get a reimbursement if you paid the immigration health surcharge (IHS) and you work in the health and 
care sector. The health and care sector included hospitals, GP practices, care homes and community healthcare facilities.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">

              There is a different process if you have a Tier 2 (Health and Care) visa and you're applying for a 
        refund. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An applicant is entitled to claim reimbursement of the IHS if that visa is not a Tier 2 (General) visa, and if they have provided the required evidence to demonstrate they have completed the eligible hours of eligible work.

 <p>Applicants will not be eligible if they were unemployed or had unpaid leave for more than 28 days during the 6 months. However, the 6 months can include paid leave, such as maternity or statutory sick leave.</p>
 <p>The applicant's dependants will also be automatically eligible. A main applicant will be able to add dependants using this service, but dependants cannot add a main applicant.</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>full name as it appears on their passport</li>
      <li>immigration health surcharge number</li>

    <p>We'll reimburse the applicant 6-months' worth of payments in arrears. Reimbursement claims cannot be made for any period before 31 March 2020.</p>

    <p>The applicant will get their reimbursement as one single payment through the same payment method they used to pay the IHS.</p>
    <p>Each time the applicant applies, they'll get 6 months' worth of the IHS they've already paid. They may need to apply every 6 months to get reimbursed.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Making a claim takes around 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>If you do not enter any information for more than 30 minutes, your application will time out and you'll have to start again.</p>
