        Apply for an immigration health surcharge reimbursement if you work in health and social care
    </h1>
  
<p>You may be able to get a reimbursement if you paid the immigration health surcharge (IHS) and you work in the health and social care sector. The health and social care sector included hospitals, GP practices, care homes and community healthcare facilities.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">

              There is a different process if you have a Tier 2 (General) visa and would be eligible for a Tier 2 (General) Health and Care visa. You may be entitled to a refund of your IHS from 31 March.
