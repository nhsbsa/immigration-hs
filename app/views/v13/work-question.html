<p>Paid work is any employment or self-employment which is liable for National Insurance, even if the minimum earnings threshold for owing National Insurance is not met. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Unpaid work, unpaid work placements and volunteering are allowed. 'Scholarship income', such as a bursary, is not considered taxable income so someone in receipt of this would remain eligible for the reimbursement. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For PHD and other students who may teach as part of their course, this will constitute paid work where they hold a contract of employment with their university.</p>
