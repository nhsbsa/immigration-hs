    <p>You may be able to get some money back if you paid an immigration health surcharge (IHS) and you work or have worked in the health and social care sector. The health and social care sector includes NHS hospitals, GP practices, care homes and community healthcare facilities. </p>

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who can apply</h2>
    <p>Either the applicant themselves or someone acting on their behalf can use this service. The information entered should be the details of the person who is eligible for a reimbursement.</p>
    <p>To be eligible to apply, the applicant must have:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>paid an immigration health surcharge covering the period of the claim</li>
      <li>worked in the health and social care sector on or after 31 March 2020</li>
      <li>worked for 6 months or more</li>
      <li>worked for an average of 16 hours per week</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p>An applicant will not be eligible if they were unemployed or had unpaid leave for more than 28 days during the 6 months. However, the 6 months can include paid leave, such as maternity or statutory sick leave.</p>


<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
          <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
            <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
              If the applicant’s work has been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19)
            </span>
          </summary>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant has been furloughed</h2>
          <p>A furloughed worker can still apply and be eligible. They should still be getting a payslip so they still need to submit evidence.</p>
          <p>They may need to show that before furlough they were meeting the minimum hours worked. For example, a person who has a zero-hour contract may need to demonstrate it, whereas someone contractually obliged to work 37 hours a week would not, as this should be indicated on their payslip.</p>
          <p>Furloughed workers are not allowed to take further paid employment and therefore should not be penalised by something outside their control.</p>
          <p>They may be unable to claim benefits because they’re considered “employed”, unless their pay is less than the maximum taper for that benefit.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant’s working hours have been reduced due to coronavirus (zero-hours contracts or work via an agency)</h2>
          <p>The applicant will still need to meet the minimum eligibility criteria for hours worked to be eligible.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant has had to self-isolate due to coronavirus (due to either having the virus or as a precautionary measure, due to being in contact with someone who has the virus)</h2>
          <p>An applicant can still apply if they’ve had a gap in employment, up to a maximum of 4 weeks (where that person was eligible before that four-week period). However, in most circumstances a person self-isolating could still be working from home, on sickness absence or on unpaid leave and would be eligible to apply in those circumstances.</p>
          <p>If there are other circumstances that you feel we need to be aware of, it would be useful to understand them so we can consider them.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant is clinically vulnerable and has been advised not to work due to increased risk.</h2>
          <p>This will depend on how an employer treats the applicant.</p>
          <p>An applicant will remain eligible if they are furloughed, or the company is still paying them. For example, if the applicant is on a statutory form of leave or the company is still paying their wages for their hours.</p>
          <p>If an employer makes that person redundant, providing the work was in an eligible role, setting and met the minimum hours prior to that redundancy, then they would only be eligible if they had been working for 6 months (or 5 months, with a gap of 4 weeks at the end of that period between employment).</p>

</details>


<br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Dependants</h2>
    <p>If the applicant is eligible, their dependants can also get a reimbursement. They must include them in the same application. Dependants don’t need to apply separately.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Applicants can apply for the reimbursement if they work in an eligible role in the health or care sector, for example: </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>direct patient care, such as a health care assistant or social care worker</li>
      <li>administrative or leadership, such as a manager in a care home or a hospital receptionist</li>
      <li>facilities management, such as a cleaner, caterer or courier in a hospital</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<p>They must also work for an eligible organisation, for example:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the NHS</li>
      <li>the Care Quality Commission (CQC)</li>
      <li>Health Education England (HEE)</li>
      <li>Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) </li>
      <li>Public Health England (PHE)</li>
      <li>the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) </li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Information the applicant will need before they apply</h2>
    <p>The applicant will need to include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>their full name as it appears on their passport </li>
      <li>their immigration health surcharge number </li>
      <li>copies of their payslips for the 6 months they’re claiming for – upload scanned documents, digital photographs or digital payslips from their employer, for example, Electronic Staff Record (ESR)</li>
      <li>access to the payment method used to pay the immigration health surcharge</li>
      <li>their dependants’ details, if applicable, including their names and immigration health surcharge numbers</li>
    </ul>
<p>The applicant can make a claim for a period of 6 months. This means they’ll need to reapply every 6 months to continue to get reimbursed.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How the applicant will get their money back</h2>
    <p>At the end of the 6-month period, we’ll pay the balance due, which is based on the amount of IHS they paid.</p>
    <p>The money will be reimbursed to the same payment method that was used to pay the IHS.</p>
    <p>The applicant will usually get their reimbursement within 6 weeks of getting a decision. It can take longer if the applicant:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>appeals the decision</li>
      <li>asks for an administrative review</li>
      <li>doesn’t provide all of the required information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This application takes around 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>If you do not enter any information for more than 30 minutes, your application will time out and you’ll have to start again.</p>
