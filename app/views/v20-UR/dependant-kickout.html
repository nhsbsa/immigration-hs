      <p class="govuk-body">If your dependant has a different claim period start date then you need to make apply for them separately after making a claim for the main applicant.</p>

      <p>You can continue with this claim for <strong>1 January 2022</strong> to <Strong>30 June 2022</Strong>, but leave out your dependant and use our dependant journey to make a separate dependant application using their claim period dates.</p>

             <p>You should wait until you receive a claim approval email from us before claiming for a dependant.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Example</h2>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">

        <p><strong>Main applicant claim period:</strong> 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022</p>
        <p><strong>Dependant claim period:</strong> 1 March 2022 to 31 August 2022</p>

        <p>You must miss your dependant from this January to June claim, and make a separate claim for March to August.</p>
        <p>You will need to provide the evidence needed for the full claim period.</p>
