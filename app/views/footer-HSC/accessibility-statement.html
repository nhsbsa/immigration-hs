      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Skip links are missing on some pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks)</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Buttons and links on some pages do not have clear or unique text, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose (In Context)) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Forms do not have labels, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.2 (Label or Instruction).</p>
