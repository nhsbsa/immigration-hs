    <p>You might be able to get a refund ('reimbursement') if you paid the immigration health surcharge (IHS) and you're a student from the EU or Switzerland.</p>

    <!--<div class="govuk-inset-text">
      The applicant should consider carefully their healthcare needs before deciding whether to apply for a reimbursement. If they intend to apply for a reimbursement of their Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) payment, they should use their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for medically necessary treatment during their studies. You may have to pay for any healthcare you receive which is not deemed medically necessary.
    </div>-->

   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must have paid IHS and all of the following must be true:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you're in full-time higher education in the UK</li>
      <li>you have a visa that started on or after 1 January 2021</li>
      <li>you have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued in an EU country or Switzerland</li>
      <li>you live in the UK and have a UK address - this can be student accommodation</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <p>If you arrived in the UK between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, you must apply for your refund by 31 December 2022.</p>
    <p>If you arrived in the UK on or after 1 January 2022, you have one year to apply from the date your visa starts.</p>


<!--<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
          <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
            <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
              If the applicant's work has been affected by coronavirus (COVID-19)
            </span>
          </summary>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant has been furloughed</h2>
          <p>A furloughed worker can still apply and be eligible. They should still be getting a payslip so they still need to submit evidence.</p>
          <p>They may need to show that before furlough they were meeting the minimum hours worked. For example, a person who has a zero-hour contract may need to demonstrate it, whereas someone contractually obliged to work 37 hours a week would not, as this should be indicated on their payslip.</p>
          <p>Furloughed workers are not allowed to take further paid employment and therefore should not be penalised by something outside their control.</p>
          <p>They may be unable to claim benefits because they're considered “employed”, unless their pay is less than the maximum taper for that benefit.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant's working hours have been reduced due to coronavirus (zero-hours contracts or work via an agency)</h2>
          <p>The applicant will still need to meet the minimum eligibility criteria for hours worked to be eligible.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant has had to self-isolate due to coronavirus (due to either having the virus or as a precautionary measure, due to being in contact with someone who has the virus)</h2>
          <p>An applicant can still apply if they've had a gap in employment, up to a maximum of 4 weeks (where that person was eligible before that four-week period). However, in most circumstances a person self-isolating could still be working from home, on sickness absence or on unpaid leave and would be eligible to apply in those circumstances.</p>
          <p>If there are other circumstances that you feel we need to be aware of, it would be useful to understand them so we can consider them.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the applicant is clinically vulnerable and has been advised not to work due to increased risk.</h2>
          <p>This will depend on how an employer treats the applicant.</p>
          <p>An applicant will remain eligible if they are furloughed, or the company is still paying them. For example, if the applicant is on a statutory form of leave or the company is still paying their wages for their hours.</p>
          <p>If an employer makes that person redundant, providing the work was in an eligible role, setting and met the minimum hours prior to that redundancy, then they would only be eligible if they had been working for 6 months (or 5 months, with a gap of 4 weeks at the end of that period between employment).</p>

</details>-->


<br>
<!--<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Dependants</h2>
    <p>Dependants are people who the applicant supports financially. For example, the applicant's spouse, civil partner, durable partner or children. </p>
      <p>If the applicant is eligible, their dependants can also get a reimbursement. They can include them in the same application. Dependants don't need to apply separately.</p>-->

    <p><strong>If you want to get a job while you study</strong></p>
    <p>You will not be eligible for a refund if you work or intend to work in the UK while you study. This is because if you start paid work your EHIC may become invalid and you will not be able to use it to access healthcare.</p>
    
    <p><strong>If you're a student from Denmark</strong></p>
    <p>There is a <a href="/guidance/healthcare-for-eu-and-efta-nationals-living-in-the-uk#when-your-healthcare-costs-in-the-uk-are-covered-by-an-eu-country">different way to get your <abbr title="immigration health surcharge">IHS</abbr> refund</a> because you'll have an EU-issued S1 certificate.</p>
    <p>If you do not have an EU-issued S1 certificate you'll need to ask the local authority in your country to give you one. You can either:</p>
