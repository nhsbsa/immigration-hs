              The applicant will be able to include details of any dependants in their claim.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once the applicant used this service, the academy then checks that the applicant has an MTI visa and certificate of sponsorship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Applicant details will then be passed to us and they (and any listed dependants) will get a full refund of their IHS, instead of getting 6 monthsâ€™ worth of their refund that they would get by using the Health and Social Care route.
            </p>

            <p>
              The NHS Business Services Authority will contact the applicant with an outcome. The applicant does not need to reapply.
