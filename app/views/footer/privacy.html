      <p class="govuk-body">Now the UK has left the EU, EU and Swiss citizens moving to the UK will be subject to immigration rules and will be required to pay the immigration health surcharge (IHS), paid in full and upfront at the point of visa application.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">As agreed with the EU under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has implemented a new scheme whereby certain EU insured S1 holders and students (and their dependants), may be entitled to a full or partial reimbursement of their IHS.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The NHS Business Services Authority is responsible for administering the IHS scheme. This scheme allows eligible applicants to get a reimbursement for the IHS paid during their visa application process.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">DHSC, NHS Business Services Authority and the Home Office are joint data controllers responsible for this service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The information in this privacy notice shows how and why the organisations responsible for the scheme will handle the personal data you provide in your application to the scheme.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we gather and use your personal data</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/our-policies/privacy/lawful-basis-processing#jumplink11">By law</a>, we must process this information to be able to provide this service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will ask you for: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>information to identify you, such as your name, address and date of birth</li>
        <li>your IHS reference number</li>
        <li>details of your qualifying employer in the health or social care sectors</li>

        <li>evidence of your qualifying Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) statement or equivalent</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’re only allowed to use, gather and share personal information where we have an appropriate legal basis to do so under Data Protection law.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">The Home Office and DHSC collects and processes personal information to fulfil its legal and official functions.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll be processing information under the ‘Article 6(1)(a)’ of the GDPR:</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">“The data subject has given us consent to the processing of his or her personal information”.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The legal basis for the processing of your data will, also fall under ‘Article 6(1)(e)’ of the GDPR: </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">“The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller”.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Sharing your personal information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">To make any reimbursement payments due to you under the scheme, we’ll share your personal data with United Kingdom Visa and Immigration (UKVI) to make the payments via UKVI’s payment portal.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">To support more effective planning and improvements to NHS services, we may share our understanding of patterns and trends gained from applicants with:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>NHS Commissioners and service providers</li>
        <li>DHSC</li>
        <li>NHS Counter Fraud Authority (NHSCFA)</li>
        <li>The Home Office (UKVI) </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">To prevent, detect and investigate fraud and errors, we may share your information with NHS service providers.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Automated decision-making and profiling</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Article 22 of the GDPR provides the right not to be subject to a decision made solely on the basis of automated processing.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Although some of our processes are automated, no decisions will be made about you based solely on automated decision-making. Automatic decision-making is where a decision is taken about you using an electronic system without human involvement. Decisions will always be taken by a trained officer or caseworker.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may use personal information, for example, from previous applicants, to develop tools that allow us to assess and then process applications in a particular way. This helps us to target our resources and make sure our processing is efficient. This allows us to minimise costs while protecting the public effectively. However, a case officer would still decide these cases. Any profiling must comply with our wider obligations under equality legislation.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Keeping your personal information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll keep your personal data on our systems and files for as long as you are eligible for the scheme.</p>
