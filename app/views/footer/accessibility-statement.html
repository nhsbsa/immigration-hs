      <p class="govuk-body">The NHS Business Services Authority is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
    
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">It may not be possible to navigate the website using speech recognition software. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) &amp; 4.1.3 (Status Messages).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Skip links are missing on some pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks)</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Buttons and links on some pages do not have clear or unique text, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose (In Context)) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Forms do not have labels, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.2 (Label or Instruction).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Changes displayed as status messages are not announced to screen reader users. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.3 (Status Messages).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We plan to fix the above accessibility issues by September 2021. When we publish new content, we'll make sure it meets accessibility standards.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Not applicable</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Not applicable</p>
    
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Interactive tools and transactions</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We’ll make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>
    
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Not applicable</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">PDFs and other document</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Not applicable</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Live video</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Not applicable</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’re committed to making sure this website is compliant to WCAG 2.1 ‘AA’ standard.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our accessibility compliance statement will be reviewed every 6 months. Every new released website will be designed, built and tested to meet ‘AA’ standards by default.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We tested all of the website screens to meet ‘AA’ WCAG 2.1 standards, using manual and automated tests.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We run each webpage through automated Wave, Lighthouse and Axe accessibility tools then manually test with screen readers (NVDA or VoiceOver) and standards checklists.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We run representative user journey tests through speech recognition software (Dragon or Voice Control).</p>
